1. Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered system to automate Excel mock interviews.
This system helps candidates practice Excel interview questions in an interactive way while reducing time and effort for hiring managers.
A key challenge in this domain is the cold start problem — the system initially lacks real interview data and must still provide meaningful interactions.
2. Approach Overview
After analyzing various solutions, the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach is recommended as the most practical and efficient solution to address the cold start problem.
It allows the system to retrieve useful Excel knowledge from a pre-built knowledge base and generate intelligent responses immediately.
3. Implementation Plan
Phase 1: MVP with RAG
- Build a basic Knowledge Base (KB) with:
    - Official Excel documentation.
    - Common Excel interview questions.
    - Excel function references and examples.

- Implement RAG Architecture:
    - Embed text data using Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
    - Store embeddings in Chroma Vector Database.
    - Query with LlamaIndex framework.

- Develop conversation management to handle interview flow.
- Build a clean web interface using Streamlit.
- Implement feedback collection mechanisms for interviewers.

Phase 2: Enhanced RAG with Feedback Loop
- Expand the knowledge base using real interview data.
- Improve retrieval mechanisms with advanced chunking strategies.
- Add structured evaluation rubrics for Excel skill levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
- Improve conversation flow with topic tracking.
- Enhance the user interface for better experience.
- Add an Analytics Dashboard to visualize performance and trends.

Phase 3: Hybrid Approach with Limited Fine-Tuning
- Fine-tune the LLM using PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) based on collected data.
- Build a hybrid system combining:
    - Knowledge retrieval (RAG).
    - Data-driven fine-tuning for better answer generation.
- Add advanced analytics and reporting features (interview summaries, skill predictions).
- Optimize performance and scalability for real-world usage.
4. Addressing the Cold Start Problem
1. Knowledge Base Bootstrapping:
    - Using Microsoft Excel official documents, interview questions, function references, and assessment rubrics.

2. Prompt Engineering:
    - Crafting clear system prompts and few-shot examples to guide the LLM.

3. Feedback Collection:
    - Logging interview interactions and collecting hiring manager ratings.

4. Incremental Improvement:
    - Expanding the knowledge base gradually.
    - Using real interview data to identify knowledge gaps and improve retrieval.
5. Key Advantages of the RAG Approach
Immediate Implementation: No large dataset required initially.
Transparency: Clear source of retrieved info for answers.
Flexibility: Easy to add new Excel topics or questions.
Cost-Effectiveness: Uses open-source tools with minimal infrastructure.
Scalability: Can handle many interviews concurrently.
Continuous Improvement: Feedback helps the system learn and improve over time.
6. Conclusion
The proposed AI-Powered Excel Mock Interviewer System offers a scalable and efficient solution to reduce interview bottlenecks.
By combining RAG with a phased development plan, the system provides immediate value, stays flexible for future growth, and improves over time using real data.
7. Summary
This solution delivers an adaptive, cost-effective, and easily deployable system for automating Excel mock interviews.
It ensures accurate and helpful interactions from day one and improves as more feedback and data are collected.
8. Risk and Mitigation
Risk: Incomplete knowledge base coverage
Mitigation: Start with core Excel topics and expand based on real usage data.

Risk: Incorrect AI-generated answers
Mitigation: Use structured prompts, few-shot examples, and feedback loop to improve accuracy.

Risk: System scalability issues
Mitigation: Deploy using Docker containers and optimized vector databases.
9. Future Enhancements
- Multi-language support for diverse candidates.
- Voice interaction for more natural conversation.
- Automated skill scoring using AI models.
- Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS) for tracking progress.
10. Example Interaction
Candidate Question:
How do I use the VLOOKUP function in Excel?

System Process:
1. Retrieve VLOOKUP documentation from knowledge base.
2. Generate answer using the LLM.

Generated Response:
The VLOOKUP function helps you search a value in the first column of a table and return a related value from another column.
Example: =VLOOKUP(A2, B2:D10, 3, FALSE) searches the value in cell A2 in the first column of the range B2:D10 and returns the corresponding value from the third column.
